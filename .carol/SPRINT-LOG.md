# SPRINT-LOG.md

**Project:** tit  
**Repository:** /Users/jreng/Documents/Poems/dev/tit  
**Started:** 2026-01-31

**Purpose:** Long-term context memory across sessions. Tracks completed work, technical debt, and unresolved issues. Written by PRIMARY agents only when user explicitly requests.

---

## 📖 Notation Reference

**[N]** = Sprint Number (e.g., `1`, `2`, `3`...)

**Sprint:** A discrete unit of work completed by one or more agents, ending with user approval ("done", "good", "commit")

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL RULES

**AGENTS BUILD CODE FOR USER TO TEST**
- Agents build/modify code ONLY when user explicitly requests
- USER tests and provides feedback
- Agents wait for user approval before proceeding

**AGENTS NEVER RUN GIT COMMANDS**
- Write code changes without running git commands
- Agent runs git ONLY when user explicitly requests
- Never autonomous git operations
- **When committing:** Always stage ALL changes with `git add -A` before commit
  - ❌ DON'T selectively stage files (agents forget/miss files)
  - ✅ DO `git add -A` to capture every modified file

**SPRINT-LOG WRITTEN BY PRIMARY AGENTS ONLY**
- **COUNSELOR** or **SURGEON** write to SPRINT-LOG
- Only when user explicitly says: `"log sprint"`
- No intermediate summary files
- No automatic logging after every task
- Latest sprint at top, keep last 5 entries

**NAMING RULE (CODE VOCABULARY)**
- All identifiers must obey project-specific naming conventions (see NAMING-CONVENTION.md)
- Variable names: semantic + precise (not `temp`, `data`, `x`)
- Function names: verb-noun pattern (initRepository, detectCanonBranch)
- Struct fields: domain-specific terminology (not generic `value`, `item`, `entry`)
- Type names: PascalCase, clear intent (CanonBranchConfig, not BranchData)

**BEFORE CODING: ALWAYS SEARCH EXISTING PATTERNS**
- ❌ NEVER invent new states, enums, or utility functions without checking if they exist
- ✅ Always grep/search the codebase first for existing patterns
- ✅ Check types, constants, and error handling patterns before creating new ones
- **Methodology:** Read → Understand → Find SSOT → Use existing pattern

**TRUST THE LIBRARY, DON'T REINVENT**
- ❌ NEVER create custom helpers for things the library/framework already does
- ✅ Trust the library/framework - it's battle-tested

**FAIL-FAST RULE (CRITICAL)**
- ❌ NEVER silently ignore errors (no error suppression)
- ❌ NEVER use fallback values that mask failures
- ❌ NEVER return empty strings/zero values when operations fail
- ❌ NEVER use early returns
- ✅ ALWAYS check error returns explicitly
- ✅ ALWAYS return errors to caller or log + fail fast

**⚠️ NEVER REMOVE THESE RULES**
- Rules at top of SPRINT-LOG.md are immutable
- If rules need update: ADD new rules, don't erase old ones

## Quick Reference

### For Agents

**When user says:** `"log sprint"`

1. **Check:** Did I (PRIMARY agent) complete work this session?
2. **If YES:** Write sprint block to SPRINT-LOG.md (latest first)
3. **Include:** Files modified, changes made, alignment check, technical debt

### For User

**Activate PRIMARY:**
```
"@CAROL.md COUNSELOR: Rock 'n Roll"
"@CAROL.md SURGEON: Rock 'n Roll"
```

**Log completed work:**
```
"log sprint"
```

**Invoke subagent:**
```
"@oracle analyze this"
"@engineer scaffold that"
"@auditor verify this"
```

**Available Agents:**
- **PRIMARY:** COUNSELOR (domain specific strategic analysis), SURGEON (surgical precision problem solving)
- **Subagents:** Pathfinder, Oracle, Engineer, Auditor, Machinist, Librarian

## SPRINT HISTORY

<!-- Example sprint entry (delete this after first real sprint) -->

## Sprint 1: Project Setup and Initial Planning ✅

**Date:** 2026-01-11  
**Duration:** 14:00 - 16:30 (2.5 hours)

### Agents Participated
- **COUNSELOR:** Kimi-K2 — Wrote SPEC.md and ARCHITECTURE.md
- **ENGINEER** (invoked by COUNSELOR) — Created project structure
- **AUDITOR** (invoked by COUNSELOR) — Verified spec compliance

### Files Modified (8 total)
- `SPEC.md:1-200` — Complete feature specification with all flows
- `ARCHITECTURE.md:1-150` — Initial architecture patterns documented
- `src/core/module.cpp:10-45` — Core module scaffolding with proper initialization
- `src/core/module.h:1-30` — Core module header with explicit dependencies
- `tests/core_test.cpp:1-50` — Test scaffolding following Testable principle
- `CMakeLists.txt:1-25` — Build configuration with explicit targets
- `README.md:1-20` — Project overview

### Alignment Check
- [x] LIFESTAR principles followed (Lean, Immutable, Findable, Explicit, SSOT, Testable, Accessible, Reviewable)
- [x] NAMING-CONVENTION.md adhered (semantic names, verb-noun functions, no type encoding)
- [x] ARCHITECTURAL-MANIFESTO.md principles applied (no layer violations, explicit dependencies)
- [x] No early returns used
- [x] Fail-fast error handling implemented

### Problems Solved
- Established project foundation following domain-specific patterns
- Defined clear module boundaries preventing layer violations

### Technical Debt / Follow-up
- Error handling needs refinement in module.cpp (marked with TODO)
- Performance requirements not yet defined for real-time constraints

**Status:** ✅ APPROVED - All files compile, tests scaffold in place
