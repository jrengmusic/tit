# TIT - Git Timeline Interface

Redesigned from scratch with solid architectural foundation.

## Build

```bash
./build.sh
```

## Run

```bash
./tit
```

## Architecture

- **Canon (main branch):** Read-only locally, clean history
- **Working branches:** Sandbox for messy operations (commit, cherry-pick, rebase, stash)
